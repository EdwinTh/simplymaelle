<p>On Saturday I was at my second <a href="http://satrdays.org/">satRday</a> conference this year, lucky me! I got to attend <a href="http://cardiff2018.satrdays.org/">satRday Cardiff</a> which was a great experience. I gave a talk about rOpenSci onboarding system of packages, find my slidedeck <a href="https://maelle.github.io/satrday_cardiff/slides#1">here</a> and other slidedecks <a href="https://github.com/satRdays/cardiff2018_talks">at this address</a>. A lot of R goodness!</p>
<p><a href="/2018/03/24/satrdaycapetown/">As I did in March for satRday Cape Town</a>, I’ll use my own tweets to summarize the event, but this time, having switched my website to <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a> I can use <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/">Hugo shortcodes</a> as <a href="https://twitter.com/romain_francois/status/977535090308866048">recommended by Romain François</a>!</p>

<h1>A few words about the conference before storrifying away</h1>
<p>One of my <a href="/bio/">part-time employers</a>, <a href="https://itsalocke.com/">Locke Data</a>, was a big sponsor of the event, so it had a nice stand including a giant chibi Steph Locke! I therefore got to meet my co-workers in the flesh, and several other people I had only interacted with online. I really enjoy socializing with fellow R addicts once in a while! The organisers did a great job, and made sure everyone felt welcomed. Maybe they had had a look at <a href="https://github.com/stephlocke/awesome-organiser-resources">Steph Locke’s list of awesome event organiser resources</a>! In any case, thanks <a href="https://github.com/daveparr">David Parr</a> and <a href="https://github.com/brennanpincardiff">Paul Brennan</a>!</p>
<p>Now, let’s have a look at the day as tweeted by me…</p>
</div>
<div id="getting-my-tweets" class="section level1">
<h1>Getting my tweets</h1>
<p>This part using <a href="http://rtweet.info/"><code>rtweet</code></a> is similar to what I had done in March, except the hashtag changed.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_tweets &lt;- rtweet::get_timeline(user = &quot;ma_salmon&quot;, n = 5000)
my_satrday_tweets &lt;- dplyr::filter(my_tweets,
                                   stringr::str_detect(text, &quot;[sS]at[rR]day[cC][dD][fF]&quot;),
                                   !is_retweet)
my_satrday_tweets &lt;- dplyr::arrange(my_satrday_tweets, created_at)</code></pre>
<p>I obtained 22 tweets.</p>

<div id="embedding-the-tweets" class="section level1">
<h1>Embedding the tweets</h1>
<p>As stated in the intro I used Hugo shortcodes: cf <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/content.html#shortcode">this section of the <code>blogdown</code> book</a>. I thought it’d be easy but having several tweets made it hard somehow: even when playing with chunk options and <code>purrr::map</code>-ping and friends, I wasn’t able to use <code>blogdown::shortcode</code> so I used its insides instead. Still, using Hugo shortcodes is easier than hacking html. <em>Edited to add: after I <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/307">opened an issue with the feature request</a> in <code>blogdown</code> dev version there’s now a <code>shortcodes</code> function, vectorized version of <code>shortcode</code>! Thanks Yihui! I changed the code below.</em></p>
<p>Enjoy reading, and if you can, attend one of the next satRday conferences, for instance in <a href="http://amsterdam2018.satrdays.org/">Amsterdam on September the 1st</a>! Or <a href="https://twitter.com/satRdays_org/status/1011627085507506177">run one yourself</a>?</p>
