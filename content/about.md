Hej! 

<img src="{{ .Site.BaseURL }}img/barbie_office.jpg" alt="maelle" width="300">

Welcome on my website, where I'll showcase my work and some data analysis/R. My posts are syndicated on <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/">R-bloggers</a>.

My last name is Salmon like the fish and the colour, and my first name, Maëlle, is derived from a Celtic word that means princess or chief. It's pronounced "Ma-El" as "ma" in "macaroni" and as the Spanish "El". The accent on the e in ë doesn't change the pronounciation, so I guess it's my crown.

I [currently](http://www.masalmon.eu/bio/) work as a (research) software engineer. Science took me places in Europe (UK, Sweden, Germany, Spain). Currently, I live in Nancy, France. I like open-source, open data and open science.
